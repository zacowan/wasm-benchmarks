# WASM Benchmarks

> A collection of benchmarks for executing WebAssembly in different environments.

For this "experiment", I had two core questions I wanted to explore:

1. What are the performance benefits of using WebAssembly over JavaScript?
2. What are the performance implications of using different languages that compile to WebAssembly?

## Available Benchmarks

The results of each benchmark are highlighted in the README.

- [Web Assembly Executed in Node.js](./packages/bench-node)
- [Web Assembly Executed in the Browser](./packages/bench-web)
